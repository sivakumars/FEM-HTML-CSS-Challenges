## My process

- Defined the global styles  - font-family font-size, font-weight, colors
- Categorized different types of text based on function and added font styles based on category.
- Categorized colors as primary and neutral
- Identified different layout configurations for the component
- Implemented the solution.

### Built with

 - HTML/CSS

### What I learned

 - Flexbox to implement the switcher layout
   - Flexbox has no effect on images, so wrap them in a container, which acts as a flex item.
     and also serves as a frame to the image
   -The default value of `flex` is `1 1 0`, which makes the `flex-basis: 0` and make the flex-items grow from there,
     so the flex items take equal space.
       - The above rule of flex-items taking equal space is not applicable when the items have different padding 
         values.
   - The default value of `flex-wrap` is `no-wrap` 

  - The process to solve design problems with just plain HTML/CSS.
