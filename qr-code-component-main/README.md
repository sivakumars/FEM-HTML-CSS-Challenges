## My process

- global configuration - font-family, font- size, font-weight , colors decalred as custom properties in the root.
- HTML structure with semantic tags.
- creating and organizing the file structure for styles.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- box-shadows

### What I learned

- Code organization for CSS.
- CSS custom properties for cascading variables.
- box-shadow techniques - Keep the lightness around 40% to 50% , so the color has broader saturation operations available.

### Continued development

- Estimation and timed development with periodic commits to github

### Useful resources

- [Josh Comeau's article on box shadows](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/designing-shadows/)
